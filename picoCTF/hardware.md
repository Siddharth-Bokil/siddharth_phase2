# 1. IQ Test
> let your input x = 30478191278.
wrap your answer with nite{ } for the flag.
As an example, entering x = 34359738368 gives (y0, ..., y11), so the flag would be nite{010000000011}.


## Solution:

- I converted the given number to binary using an online tool.
- This binary was of 35 digits but the question asked for 36 inputs, so I added a 0 at the MSB.
- Solving the logic circuit manually gave me the values for y0,y1...,y11 which then revealed the flag.

## Flag:

```
nite{100010011000}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- Logic gates

## Notes:

- Initially I thought some not operators were to be interpreted differently, but later found it they were normal not/chaining operators.
