# 1. Hide And Seek

> Sakamoto’s at it again with a game of hide and seek, but this time, it’s not with Shin or his daughter. An old friend hid some secret data in this image. Can you find it before the others do? Hint: Even in retirement, Sakamoto never loses at hide and seek. Maybe stegseek can help you keep up.



## Solution:

- Ran stegseek on the image to get the flag.

```bash
sid@sidsAsusZenbook:~/cryptoTP/curated/hideAndSeek$ stegseek sakamoto.jpg rockyou.txt 
StegSeek 0.6 - https://github.com/RickdeJager/StegSeek

[i] Found passphrase: "iloveyou1"
[i] Original filename: "flag.txt".
[i] Extracting to "sakamoto.jpg.out".

sid@sidsAsusZenbook:~/cryptoTP/curated/hideAndSeek$ cat sakamoto.jpg.out 
nite{h1d3_4nd_s33k_but_w1th_st3g_sdfu9s8}
sid@sidsAsusZenbook:~/cryptoTP/curated/hideAndSeek$ 
```


## Flag:

```
nite{h1d3_4nd_s33k_but_w1th_st3g_sdfu9s8}
```


## Concepts learnt:

- Stegseek


## Notes:

- The challenge was pretty straightforward, since stegseek is literally mentioned in the description.

- Stegseek man page

# 2. Nutrela Chunks

> One of my favorite foods is soya chunks. But as I was enjoying some Nutrela today, I noticed a few chunks weren’t quite right. Seems like something’s off with their structure. Could you help me fix these broken chunks so I can enjoy my meal again?

# 4. NineTails

> Looks like I got a little too clever and hid the flag as a password in Firefox, tucked away like one of NineTails’ many tails. Recover the "logins" and the "key4" and let it guide you to the flag. Hint: I named my Ninetails "j4gjesg4", quite a peculiar name isn't it?

# 5. Re:Draw

> Her screen went black and a strange command window flickered to life, lines of text flashed across before everything went silent. Moments later, the system crashed. By sheer luck, we recovered a memory dump. Note: There are three stages to this challenge and you will find three flags. What we know: just before the crash, a black command window flickered across the screen, something in its output might still be visible if you dig through memory. She was drawing when it happened, and remnants of a painting program linger, which could reveal more if inspected in the right way. Finally, a mysterious archive hides deeper in memory, likely holding the last piece of her work. Hint: Learn up on volatility 2 and its various plugins and what they are used for.
